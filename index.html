          <h2>Why Venice?</h2>
          <h3>Venice, the city on water</h3>
          <p>Venice is built on a group of 126 islands that are separated by expanses of open water and by canals;
            portions of the city
            are linked by 472 bridges. The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the
            mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). In 2020, around
            258,685
            people resided in greater Venice or the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 51,000 live in the historical
            island
            city of Venice (centro storico) and the rest on the mainland (terraferma). Together with the cities of Padua
            and Treviso, Venice is included in he Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area, which is considered a
            statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million.
